<div>This project is about developing an mobile app that is both aiming to patients and doctors, intending to improve enhance doctors' workflow and patient flow and satisfaction.&nbsp; It will consists features of booking and scheduling system, integrating with navigation system and Electronic Health Record features in order of improve patient flow and&nbsp; giving physicians more flexibility. The app will also equip with internal communication system to increase efficiency and patient traffic management to improve workflow.&nbsp;</div>

<div><strong>Motivation </strong></div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The size of hospital nowadays are growing much larger, as well as the number of patients they receive. Some problems were brought due to the bigger size of hospital. As physicians,&nbsp; working in large hospital means less flexible working hours, less efficient internal communication and rigid workflow. To patient, the complexity of&nbsp; internal facility and poor management can waste time and energy before they get medical care, thus lower patient satisfaction.&nbsp; This project want to solve these problem by design an hospital management app.&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Description </strong></div>
<div><strong>&nbsp; </strong>a mobile app that can centralize information, document and data together without.</div>
<ol>
<li>
<div>an management app that enhance workflow by giving physicians more flexibility.</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>hospital management system that can improve patient flow.</div>

</ol>
<div>1&amp;2== increase the workflow and patient flow by designing an app that can give more flexible schedule to physicians and necessary information to patient.</div>
<div>physicians'need----increase internal communication and flexibility---scheduling app.&nbsp;</div>
<div>patient's need---an app shows relevant information about waiting times, patient occupancy, scheduled surgeries and so on.</div>
<ul>
<li>
<div>patient satisfaction==patient--booking and easy to use record management</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>care coordination==doctors</div>
</li>
<li>
<div>facility management==administrators--budgeting, communication with departments and staff, control over schedules and supply management.</div>
</li>
</ul>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The app are designed used both by patients and doctors by dividing into professional and normal version. Patient can download normal version in app store and register freely, doctors should use the username and password provided by hospital to get professional accreditation. The app is especially designed to used in hospital, as most hospitals can use it seamlessly. But if the hospital need customisation service, the app can be used as a template to design the management system based on&nbsp; individual user and hospital workflow.</div>
<div>The biggest strength of the app is the integration of several features. By using the app, doctors can post on their available time based on their need, as patient can book the appointment through calendar-like scheduling system. This feature will increase the satisfaction rate both for patients and and doctor. Patients can get more direct and easy booking experience, as the appointment will stored in calendar in patient's smartphone and&nbsp; send notification at the appointment day. Doctor can also get more flexibility , as the available time are chosen by themselves.&nbsp; This part of&nbsp; function are designed similar as a popular Australian app--HotDoc, but HotDoc is more focused on independent practitioner and small clinic, as the introduction of this feature to larger hospital can significantly attract doctors to work more in hospital rather than independently.&nbsp; During the booking process, health administration staff will coordinate the appointment by communicating with department and staff.</div>
<div>After the appointment has made, the patient side app will show the navigation to the hospital, indoor guide to specific doctor's office and parking help. When large hospital today can be large and complex, this feature can increase patient's experience and reduce the pressure for guidance staff, as they often have to answer same question many times a day.&nbsp; And the professional version of the app will load the electronic health records&nbsp; of patients, including medical records and medication history ,which improve workflow as many patients&nbsp; are not able to describe or remember their history.</div>
<div>The app will also equip with Internal communication and document exchange system, providing secure internal communication between hospital staff.&nbsp; As most staff may not able to find&nbsp; other staff easily, a chat room especially designed for them can increase the efficiency of hospital.&nbsp; Patient traffic management are also integrated in the app by coordinating with different departments of the hospital to calculating about waiting time and showing room occupancy to improve patient flow.</div>
